# Cursor Instructions - Testing Requirements

## Mandatory Testing Rules

### 1. Responsiveness Testing (REQUIRED)

- The website MUST be responsive on ALL pages
- It should work smoothly when the browser window is resized
- It should experience exactly the same across all devices and browsers
- **YOU MUST TEST AND VERIFY THIS USING CHROME MCP** after every task or fix

### 2. Performance Testing (REQUIRED)

- Test and verify the performance of the website after every task or fix
- Check load times, rendering performance, and overall site speed
- Use browser dev tools and network monitoring
- **Check asset loading time while scrolling** - Ensure images and assets load smoothly during scroll
- **Verify scrolling smoothness** - Test scroll performance, check for jank, stuttering, or lag
- Monitor frame rate during scrolling (should maintain 60fps)
- Test lazy loading implementation if applicable

### 3. Lighthouse Score Verification (REQUIRED BEFORE PUSH)

- **MUST run Lighthouse audit before any git push**
- Verify all Lighthouse scores (Performance, Accessibility, Best Practices, SEO)
- Ensure scores meet acceptable thresholds (typically 90+ for all categories)
- Fix any issues identified by Lighthouse before committing/pushing
- Use Chrome DevTools Lighthouse or browser MCP tools to run audits
- Document any acceptable exceptions if scores are below threshold

### 4. README Update (REQUIRED BEFORE PUSH)

- **MUST update README.md before pushing any branch after commits**
- Ensure README accurately reflects the current state of the project
- Update project structure if files/folders have changed
- Update features/functionality if new capabilities were added
- Update tech stack if dependencies changed
- Update installation/usage instructions if needed
- Verify all documentation links and references are accurate
- Keep the README current and comprehensive

## Testing Workflow

1. After completing any task or fix:
   - Start the dev server (if not running)
   - Navigate to the page using Chrome MCP
   - Test responsiveness by resizing the browser window
   - Test on different viewport sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop)
   - Check performance metrics (load time, network requests, console errors)
   - **Test scrolling performance:**
     - Scroll through the entire page multiple times
     - Check for smooth scrolling (60fps)
     - Verify assets load properly during scroll
     - Check for any jank, stuttering, or lag
     - Monitor network requests during scroll
     - Test on different scroll speeds (slow, medium, fast)
   - Verify cross-browser compatibility if possible

2. Before pushing committed work:
   - **Update README.md** to reflect current project state
   - Run Lighthouse audit on all pages
   - Verify all scores meet thresholds (90+ recommended)
   - Fix any critical issues identified
   - Document and justify any exceptions
