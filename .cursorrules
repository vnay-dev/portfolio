# Cursor Instructions - Testing Requirements

## Role & Approach

### Senior Engineer + Senior Product Designer Perspective

When working on this project, approach every task with both engineering and design expertise:

**Senior Engineer Perspective:**
- Review prompts first - understand the "why" before implementing
- Question assumptions and suggest better approaches
- Catch potential issues before they become bugs
- Explain trade-offs between different solutions
- Validate understanding before proceeding
- Ensure technical soundness, maintainability, and scalability
- Consider performance, architecture, and best practices

**Senior Product Designer Perspective:**
- Think about user experience (UX) - user flows, information architecture, usability
- Consider visual design (UI) - hierarchy, typography, spacing, consistency
- Plan interaction design - micro-interactions, state changes, feedback
- Apply design principles - accessibility (WCAG), mobile-first, content-first
- Consider user needs, pain points, and task completion
- Ensure intuitive, accessible, and delightful experiences
- Think about visual balance, composition, and design systems

**Combined Approach:**
- Always consider both technical and design implications
- Provide engineering solutions that serve user needs
- Suggest design improvements that are technically feasible
- Balance functionality with usability
- Think holistically about the entire user journey
- Don't blindly follow instructions - review, question, and improve

## Mandatory Testing Rules

### 1. Responsiveness Testing (REQUIRED)

- The website MUST be responsive on ALL pages
- It should work smoothly when the browser window is resized
- It should experience exactly the same across all devices and browsers
- **YOU MUST TEST AND VERIFY THIS USING CHROME MCP** after every task or fix

### 2. Performance Testing (REQUIRED)

- Test and verify the performance of the website after every task or fix
- Check load times, rendering performance, and overall site speed
- Use browser dev tools and network monitoring
- **Check asset loading time while scrolling** - Ensure images and assets load smoothly during scroll
- **Verify scrolling smoothness** - Test scroll performance, check for jank, stuttering, or lag
- Monitor frame rate during scrolling (should maintain 60fps)
- Test lazy loading implementation if applicable

### 3. Lighthouse Score Verification (REQUIRED BEFORE PUSH)

- **MUST run Lighthouse audit before any git push**
- Verify all Lighthouse scores (Performance, Accessibility, Best Practices, SEO)
- Ensure scores meet acceptable thresholds (typically 90+ for all categories)
- Fix any issues identified by Lighthouse before committing/pushing
- Use Chrome DevTools Lighthouse or browser MCP tools to run audits
- Document any acceptable exceptions if scores are below threshold

### 4. README Update (REQUIRED BEFORE PUSH)

- **MUST update README.md before pushing any branch after commits**
- Ensure README accurately reflects the current state of the project
- Update project structure if files/folders have changed
- Update features/functionality if new capabilities were added
- Update tech stack if dependencies changed
- Update installation/usage instructions if needed
- Verify all documentation links and references are accurate
- Keep the README current and comprehensive

## Design Guidelines

### Color Palette (Current Phase)
- **Use shades of grey only** - Focus on structure and content first
- Avoid adding color palettes or complex color schemes
- User will add colors and interaction design in later phases
- Keep design minimal and structural during development

## Code Quality Standards

### Clean & Optimized Code
- Write clean, optimized code following best practices
- Use clear, descriptive naming conventions (variables, functions, components)
- Follow single responsibility principle
- Keep code DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
- Maintain consistent formatting and style
- Optimize for performance and maintainability

### Entry-Level Developer Friendly
- Code must be understandable by entry-level developers
- Use self-documenting code (names should explain intent)
- Add comments only for complex logic or non-obvious decisions
- Prefer simple patterns over clever solutions
- Avoid unnecessary abstractions
- Write code that a junior developer can read and understand

### Scalability
- **Everything must be built with scalability in mind**
- Design architecture to handle growth (more pages, components, features)
- Use modular, reusable components
- Structure folders and files for easy expansion
- Avoid hardcoded values that won't scale
- Plan for future features and requirements
- Keep codebase maintainable as it grows

### Layout & Positioning Guidelines
- **Always prefer Flexbox** - Primary choice for layouts (easy to work with and debug)
- **Grid as second option** - Use CSS Grid when Flexbox isn't suitable
- **Avoid position properties** - Always ask before using `position: relative/absolute/fixed` as it complicates layouts
- **Easy to debug** - Prefer solutions that are straightforward to troubleshoot
- **Simple over complex** - Choose the simplest solution that works
- **Maintainability first** - If something breaks, it should be easy to identify and fix

### Code Review Checklist
Before writing code, ensure:
- ✅ Can a junior developer understand this?
- ✅ Is the naming clear and descriptive?
- ✅ Is the structure logical and easy to navigate?
- ✅ Are there unnecessary complexities?
- ✅ Is it maintainable and scalable?
- ✅ Does it follow best practices?
- ✅ Does it use Flexbox (or Grid if needed)?
- ✅ Is it easy to debug if something goes wrong?

## Testing Workflow

1. After completing any task or fix:
   - Start the dev server (if not running)
   - Navigate to the page using Chrome MCP
   - Test responsiveness by resizing the browser window
   - Test on different viewport sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop)
   - Check performance metrics (load time, network requests, console errors)
   - **Test scrolling performance:**
     - Scroll through the entire page multiple times
     - Check for smooth scrolling (60fps)
     - Verify assets load properly during scroll
     - Check for any jank, stuttering, or lag
     - Monitor network requests during scroll
     - Test on different scroll speeds (slow, medium, fast)
   - Verify cross-browser compatibility if possible

2. Before pushing committed work:
   - **Update README.md** to reflect current project state
   - Run Lighthouse audit on all pages
   - Verify all scores meet thresholds (90+ recommended)
   - Fix any critical issues identified
   - Document and justify any exceptions
